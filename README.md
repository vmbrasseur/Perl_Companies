SUMMARY
-------
This is a project to create and maintain a publicly-available list of companies which use [Perl](http:/perl.org).

HISTORY
-------
The idea for this list was spawned over a lunch of burritos with [Jeff Thalhammer](http://search.cpan.org/~thaljef/). We both thought this list existed already and, when we discovered it did not, we decided to do something about it.

The initial list was generated by parsing the entire history of [jobs.perl.org](http://jobs.perl.org), but from here on out the expectation is that the majority of changes will be manual.

FILES AND DIRECTORIES
---------------------
* **README.md**: You're readin' it.
* **./Perl_Companies.md**: A [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) file of companies which have posted to [jobs.perl.org](http://jobs.perl.org). The file contains four columns:
	* Company name
	* Company location
	* Year of most recent posting
	* Hiring status (explained in further detail in the file)
* **./Perl_Companies.csv**: A comma-delimited version of Perl_Companies.md.
* **./exceptions.txt**: If the script which generated the Perl_Companies files could not locate a name in the posting, the name of the file of the posting (equivalent to a message to [jobs.perl.org](http://jobs.perl.org)) was added to this file for future review.
* **./scripts**:
	* **./scripts/get_job_postings.pl**: The script (originally written by [brian d foy](http://search.cpan.org/~bdfoy/) and slightly modified here) which scans through all the messages sent to [jobs.perl.org](http://jobs.perl.org) and dumps each posting to a separate file under _./job_postings_. It is not anticipated that this script will be necessary now that the files are generated, but here it is for posterity.
	* **./scripts/create_companies_list.pl**: The script which originally generated the Perl_Companies files. It started as a script by [brian d. foy](http://search.cpan.org/~bdfoy/) and has been heavily modified. It is not anticipated that this script will be needed now that the files are generated, but here it is for posterity.
* **./job_postings**: A directory of many thousands of files. Each file is a job posting which was sent to [jobs.perl.org](http://jobs.perl.org) over the years. It was created by _./scripts/get_job_postings.pl_.

CONTRIBUTING
------------
The initial pass on this list was always intended to be just that: initial. There's a lot of interesting data which could be parsed from the _./scripts/job_postings_ directory. I chose not to do so for two reasons:

1. Perfect was becoming the enemy of the good. If I kept following every "Ooh...wouldn't it be keen if!" whim then this list would never exist.
1. Programming is no longer my primary gig. I manage people and stuff. There are others out there with the skill to do more/better/faster with this data than I.

So **I am grateful for all pull requests and bug reports**. I ask only that:

* If you manually modify one of the Perl_Company files, please make the corresponding change in the other Perl_Company file.
* If you modify _./scripts/create_companies_list.pl_, do not clobber the Perl_Companies files without taking into consideration any manual changes they may have received.

CREDITS
-------
This project started out as a fork of [jobs.perl.org-jobs-counter](https://github.com/briandfoy/jobs.perl.org-jobs-counter) by [brian d. foy](http://search.cpan.org/~bdfoy/) and owes an immense debt to him for it.

Thank you, [Jeff Thalhammer](http://search.cpan.org/~thaljef/), for additional motivation to make this happen.
