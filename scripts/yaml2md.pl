__DATA__

Perl Companies
==============

This is a list of companies which use (or used) Perl. The list was initially built using posts to [jobs.perl.org](http://jobs.perl.org) but from there on out it will be maintained manually by the community.

Most of the table below is self-explanatory, save the 'Hiring Status' column. An explanation of those values:

* **Active**: Company has posted an open Perl position at some point since 2011.
* **Dormant**: Company last posted an open Perl position between 2008 and 2011. The assumption is that either the company merely has not had a Perl opening for a while, has switched away from Perl, or is no longer a going business concern.
* **Inactive**: Company has not posted an open Perl position since before 2008. The assumption is that the company has either switched away from Perl or is no longer a going business concern.
