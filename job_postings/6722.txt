Description:
Spire Vision has an opening for a Scripting and Database Developer. We need
a responsible and independent programmer with a strong background in
object-oriented programming who can help us design and build the next
generation of our online marketing platform. Our offices are onsite in
midtown New York City, where the majority of work will take place.

Our goal is to rebuild an existing, functional web application and back-end
system over the next few months to add scalability and reliability to an
already functional system. Candidates should be comfortable working with
object-oriented scripting languages in a web environment, and should be
willing to learn new language skills and modules in order to implement
desired functionality. Some experience with database-backed applications is
also required, especially experience designing database schema for new
applications.

Also, must love dogs. 


Required skills:
Responsibilities: 
 Learn existing Perl/DBI software to support ongoing issues (adding minor
features, diagnosing and fixing bugs, modifying script parameters).
 Design and build a new database infrastructure and application front-end
for and existing workflow.
 Handle future maintenance and ongoing development of new software.
 Thoroughly document existing and new software for other team members.
 Test and validate software, including load testing of applications and
database configurations.

Required Skills: 
 Perl programming: Object-oriented Perl, database operations (on MySQL, in
particular), and web applications. CGI and/or mod_perl experience is
absolutely required.
 Python/Ruby/PHP programming: One or more natively object-oriented
languages, including database operations and web application programming.
 Software engineering: Some understanding of Agile development practices,
and a good comfort level with goal-setting and short development cycles.
Experience formulating and implementing user stories a plus.
 Unit and integration testing: Ability to write and maintain testing
frameworks to verify code.
 Operational and load testing: Ability to develop and operate performance
benchmarking and load testing frameworks for applications.
 Documentation: Ability to write implementation and interface
documentation, and a strong understanding of why documentation is
necessary.
 Communications: Good written and oral communications skills are
absolutely necessary!
 Leadership: Willingness to take responsibility for projects and drive
development efforts. Experience training other programmers and building a
team will be extremely valuable.
 Forward thinking: Ability to consider future growth and analyze
scalability of existing systems and software, and to apply those insights
to current development practices.
