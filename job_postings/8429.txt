Mason please make sure they have a int. to sr. level Object oriented exp.
in PERL.  The back end for the system is using MySQL. Other standard SQL

*Operate without finely-detailed specs and be able to make design and user
interface decisions on your own.  
*Help design user interfaces and web forms.  
*Deliver applications that not only work well, but are attractive, have
good user interface, and match the rest of the site in appearance and
operation. 
*Document your work and conform to established coding standards and
methodologies. 
*Perform Linux system administration tasks and work with existing staff to
design and implement architectural changes. 

Required skills:
  Two years experience with Object-Oriented Perl programming (mod_perl
programming desirable; experience with Mason is a strong plus). 
  Two years experience with SQL programming and database design for a
relational database management system (MySQL, Oracle, Sybase, etc.). 
  Two years experience with UNIX (preferably Linux) system administration.

  Ability to hand-code high-quality HTML, CSS, Dynamic HTML, and
JavaScript. 
  Experience with ColdFusion or similar tag-based languages. 
  Must be able to handle fast-paced, high-performance environment with
highly talented peers.	You will be a key member of a small team, so you
need to be versatile and enjoy taking on new challenges. 
  On-call, with shared pager duty every few weeks. 
  Very good communication skills and good written English.

functional, efficient, and work well.
