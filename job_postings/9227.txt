Description:
Spire Vision has an opening for a Perl and Database Developer. We need a
responsible and independent programmer with a strong background in
object-oriented programming who can help us design and build the next
generation of our online marketing platform. Our offices are onsite in
midtown New York City, where the majority of work will take place.

Also, must love dogs.

Responsibilities:
 Learn existing Perl/DBI software to support ongoing issues (adding minor
features, diagnosing and fixing bugs, modifying script parameters).
 Assist in the design and construction of a new database infrastructure
and application front-end for existing workflow.
 Handle future maintenance and ongoing development of new software.
 Thoroughly document existing and new software for other team members.
 Test and validate software, including load testing of applications and
database configurations.

Our goal is to rebuild an existing web application and back-end system over
the next few months to add scalability and reliability while maintaining
our current system. Candidates should be comfortable working with
object-oriented scripting languages in a web environment, and should be
willing to learn new programming, language and design skills in order to
implement desired functionality. Experience with database-driven
applications is also required, especially experience designing database
schema for new applications.

Required skills:
 Perl programming: Object-oriented Perl, database operations (on MySQL, in
particular), and web applications. CGI and/or mod_perl experience is
absolutely required.
 Software engineering: Some understanding of Agile development practices
and design patterns.
 Comfort with setting and meeting deadlines, goal-setting and short
development cycles.
 Willingness to take responsibility for projects and be open to direction
and new ways of building software.
 Unit and integration testing: Ability to write and maintain testing
frameworks to verify code.
 Documentation: Ability to write implementation and interface
documentation, and a strong understanding of why documentation is
necessary.
 Communications: Good written and oral communications skills are
absolutely necessary!
 Forward thinking: Ability to consider future growth and analyze
scalability of existing systems and software, and to apply those insights
to current development practices.


Desired skills:
Database Administration, System Design & Design Patterns, Python/Ruby/Java
or other OO language, UML, Network Administration, mod_perl, Javascript,
PHP
