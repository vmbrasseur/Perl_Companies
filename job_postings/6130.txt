hands-on programmer with the ability to customize, build, manage and

 Experienced in HTML, Javascript, XML, Perl, MySQL (database
design/optimization), DNS, and Apache.
 Email processing and experience preferred, but not critical if you are
willing to learn it.

 Willingness to manage projects and people. We뭨e looking to hire a
leader.
 Experience with MySQL Performance Tuning and Perl Code Optimization.
 Creative approach to problem solving and can-do attitude. When you

recommended solution, next steps, timing...etc.
